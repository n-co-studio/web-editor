# Workflow

## Execution Loop

1. **Plan** — goal, scope, files, verification steps
2. **Build** — small, reviewable increments
3. **Verify** — cohesion review (Critic checks diff for internal coherence), then gate checks (QA verifies A1–A5 + push gates)
4. **Commit** — only after all gates pass

## Advisory Board Review

Runs after Prompt 0 completes, before Prompt B. Orchestrated by Prompt A Phase 1. Uses tiered activation to match review depth to scope. Re-initialization (after agent drift, decision conflicts, template sync, or mid-build spec changes) skips advisory review and goes directly to Phase 3 validation — operator selects the mode when Prompt A starts.

1. **Select tier** — Orchestrator picks Lite / Standard / Full based on scope (operator can override or skip)
2. **Activate** — Dispatch agents for the selected tier; scan for conditional signals at Full tier
3. **Review** — Specialists analyze specs in parallel, produce focused briefs
4. **Synthesize** — Orchestrator merges briefs into a Refinement Report
5. **Decide** — Operator reviews each finding: accept / reject / defer
6. **Proceed** — All critical findings addressed, move to Repo OS validation (Phase 3)

See `.claude/agents/_advisory-board.md` for tier definitions, activation logic, and report structure.

## HVST Protocol (debugging/instability)

Use when: fixing bugs, failing tests, unstable behavior. Not required for simple feature work.

Loop: **Hypothesis** → **Validate** (smallest experiment) → **Solve** (minimal fix) → **Test** (rerun checks) → **Record**

**Record** (after 2+ failed cycles): When resolved, add entry to `docs/ai/logs/known-issues.md` if not already present. At 2 consecutive failures, check `known-issues.md` for matches before continuing.

**Review Board** (optional): At 2+ consecutive failures or on operator request, Orchestrator dispatches Architect + Exploration + Critic (hypothesis mode) to review failure context and produce ranked hypotheses before further fix attempts. See `.claude/agents/_hvst-review.md`.

## Branch Categories

Work happens on categorized branches. Never commit directly to `main` — merge via PR only. See `docs/ai/quality-gates.md` for branch types and gate mapping.

## Session Lifecycle

At session close: verify all changes, commit, update session log (`docs/ai/logs/session-log.md`). Zero-change sessions (no commits, no working tree changes) are exempt from the session log requirement — the stop hook downgrades to advisory instead of blocking. Ask operator whether to create a PR to merge to `main` — do not skip or defer without explicit operator direction. Does not apply to `experiment/*` branches.

### Prototype Sessions

Prototype sessions on `experiment/*` branches follow a lighter lifecycle. See `docs/ai/prompts/prompt-0.5-prototype.md` for full details. Key differences:
- **No plan-before-code requirement** — the experiment brief (Spike/PoC) or verbal direction (Napkin) is the plan
- **A4 safety only** — no process, quality, or review gates
- **Simplified session log** — one-line entry referencing the prototype brief
- **Agent chain** — Orchestrator + Builder only (no QA/Reviewer/Security unless requested)
- **At close** — update the Learnings and Disposition sections of the brief before deleting the branch

### Task Definition Sessions

Prompt T facilitates exploration and task planning without producing file artifacts. Two modes:
- **Query**: Conversational Q&A grounded in specs and codebase. No agent dispatch.
- **Brief**: 3-agent team (Architect, Exploration, Critic) produces a structured task brief for Prompt B.

Task definition sessions are fully ephemeral — no files written, no session log entries, no gates apply. The output is a terminal-displayed task brief the operator copy-pastes into a new Prompt B session. See `docs/ai/prompts/prompt-t-task-definition.md` for full details.
